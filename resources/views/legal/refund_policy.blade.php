      <h2>Refund Policy Overview:</h2>
      <p>Yensoft Limited Company does not offer refunds on any software products, services, or licenses purchased from us.
        All sales are considered final once the transaction is completed. This policy is in place due to the nature of our
        digital products and the effort put into customizing and tailoring solutions to meet individual client requirements.</p>

      <h2>Our Commitment:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Product Excellence:</strong> We take great pride in the quality of our software products and services.
            Our team works diligently to create reliable, efficient, and effective solutions that cater to your unique needs.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pre-Sale Clarifications:</strong> Prior to making a purchase, we encourage you to reach out to our
            sales team to address any questions or concerns you may have. We are committed to providing detailed information
            and assisting you in making informed decisions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Post-Sale Support:</strong> After the purchase, our dedicated customer support team is available to
            provide assistance and address any issues that may arise. We are committed to resolving technical or operational
            concerns to ensure your software functions as intended.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <section>
      <h2> Why We Don't Offer Refunds:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Our software solutions often require customizations to align with the specific
            requirements of each client. These customizations are time-intensive and tailored to your needs, making refunds
            impractical.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Once a software product is delivered, it involves the transfer of
            intellectual property and proprietary code. Refunding such transactions could compromise the protection of our
            intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Digital Nature:</strong> As digital goods, our software products are not subject to return in the same
            way physical products might be. Once delivered, there is no feasible way to ensure the return of the software
            or the removal of its usage.
        </li>
    </ol>

            agreement, we will work diligently to rectify the situation. If a scenario arises where a refund might be
            considered, such cases will be evaluated on an individual basis, and a decision will be made in line with our
            commitment to customer satisfaction and fairness.</p>
